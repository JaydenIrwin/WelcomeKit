# WelcomeKit

This package is an extremely easy way to recreate the "Welcome" (or "What's New") screen that's native to Apple platforms.

The view is written in SwiftUI, but also includes a view controller to easily use it in UIKit.

If you present this in UIKit, setting "modalPresentationStyle = .formSheet" is recommened.
